# StatRev_IndirectGene
A repository for the statistical review of all the indirect genetic effects models. 

## Research Goal
Simulate indirect genetic effects with a modified version of GeneEvolve. Use the simulated data to fit as many models on indirect genetic effects as possible to compare the bias and accuracy of the estimates under various conditions (including but not limited to sample sizes, the strength of PGS and the effect sizes of different indirect genetic effects). Come up with a clear guideline for future empirical research on indirect genetic effects from a modeling standpoint (in contrast to a phenotypic standpoint).
